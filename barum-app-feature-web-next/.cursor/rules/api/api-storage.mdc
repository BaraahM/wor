# Storage Rules

Follow these rules when working with Supabase Storage.

It uses uploads, downloads, and management.

## General Rules

- Always use envires to maintain consistency across environments
- Never hardcode bucket names in the application code
- Always handle file size limits and allowed file types at the application level
- Use the `upsert` method instead of `upload` when you want to replace existing files
- Always implement proper error handling for storage operations
- Use content-type headers when uploading files

### Buckets

- Name buckets in kebab-case: `user-uploads`, `profile-images`
- Create separate buckets for different types of files (e.g., `profile-images`, `documents`, `attachments`)
- Document bucket purposes in a central location
- Set appropriate bucket policies (public/private) based on access requirements
- Implement RLS (Row Level Security) policies for buckets that need user-specific access
- Make sure to let me know instructions for setting up RLS policies on Supabase since you can't do this yourself, including the SQL scripts I need to run in the editor

### File Structure

- Organize files in folders based on their purpose and ownership
- Use predictable, collision-resistant naming patterns
- Structure: `{bucket}/{userId}/{purpose}/{filename}`
- Example: `profile-images/123e4567-e89b/avatar/profile.jpg`
- Include timestamps in filenames when version history is important
- Example: `documents/123e4567-e89b/contracts/2024-02-13-contract.pdf`

## Actions

- Name files like `example-storage-actions.ts`
- Include Storage at the end of function names `Ex: uploadFile -> uploadFileStorage`


## File Handling

### Upload Rules

- Always validate file size before upload
- Implement file type validation using both extension and MIME type
- Generate unique filenames to prevent collisions
- Set appropriate content-type headers
- Handle existing files appropriately (error or upsert)

Example validation:

```ts
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024 // 10MB
const ALLOWED_TYPES = ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/webp"]

function validateFile(file: File): boolean {
  if (file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
    throw new Error("File size exceeds limit")
  }
  
  if (!ALLOWED_TYPES.includes(file.type)) {
    throw new Error("File type not allowed")
  }
  
  return true
}
```

### Download Rules

- Always handle missing files gracefully
- Implement proper error handling for failed downloads
- Use signed URLs for private files

### Delete Rules

- Implement soft deletes when appropriate
- Clean up related database records when deleting files
- Handle bulk deletions carefully
- Verify ownership before deletion
- Always delete all versions/transforms of a file

## Security

### Bucket Policies

- Make buckets private by default
- Only make buckets public when absolutely necessary
- Use RLS policies to restrict access to authorized users
- Example RLS policy:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own files"
ON storage.objects
FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

### Access Control

- Generate short-lived signed URLs for private files
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use separate buckets for public and private files
- Never expose internal file paths
- Validate user permissions before any operation

## Error Handling

- Implement specific error types for common storage issues
- Always provide meaningful error messages
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Log storage errors separately for monitoring

## Optimization

- Implement progressive upload for large files
- Clean up temporary files and failed uploads
- Use batch operations when handling multiple files
